# My Portfolio Starter

## Description

Create a starter portfolio page for myself.  Need to make sure all links that are on the page function correctly.  This project helped me get familiar with grid layouts and image styling and animations.  

## Table of Contents

## Installation
Should run smoothly in any VSCode editor

## Usage
When you open the page, at the top right corner there are 3 item links.  You should be able to click on each link and be take directly to that section on the page.

In the "Work" section of the page, the 5 images should come into focus and have a background border when the mouse is hovered over it. 

The "Contact Me" links should all function as expected.
Please critique and let me know what I have missed.
